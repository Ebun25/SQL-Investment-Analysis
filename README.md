# SQL-Business-Challenge
 This project provides thorough analysis and recommendations for clients based on portfolio returns, risk, and correlations across assets using SQL queries on the "invest" schema. Recent returns, correlations, risk, and suggestions for adding new securities to the portfolio or reducing existing holdings are among the questions that are addressed.
